"After 3 years in retail and 2 years working for a banking company, I decided to go back to my first intuition: Coding. \
To do so, I enrolled into 42 school in Paris. Which was a revelation. Thanks to this school, I had the opportunity to learn a lot. \
Multi-threading, algorithm complexity, pointers, linked list, binary tree, and so on. \
I also had the chance to work on a lot of projects, from a shell to a full web site. Thanks to this school, I worked with a lot of different people, from different backgrounds, different cultures, different ages. \
I learned a lot from them.",

"Following a year and a half in 42, I had the opportunity to do an internship as Full Stack Developer at a company called Legal Place. \
This mission gave me an idea of how things work. From the conception of the project to the deployment. I was hired to create a proof of concept of a new API. \
I had to create a server that can use this API and see what we could do with it. After this mission, I was integrated into the team and I had the chance to work on a lot of different jobs. \
From fixing iFrame bugs, using aws lambda and Simple Queue Service, finding a way to de-duplicate multiple webhooks calls, and so on",

"After this internship, Legal Place wanted to hire me, but I had a new challenge in mind. I wanted to go work across the ocean... \
So I left France and I came to Canada. Me, my motivation, my smile and my visa, are looking for an opportunity to grow and learn more.",

"In my free time, I like doing all kinds of sports, from gym to climbing through running. I also like to read and play video games."
